## Scoring Guide

Rate each cell: ◎ (excellent) / ○ (good) / △ (acceptable) / ✕ (poor)

### Maturity

- ◎ 3+ years in production, stable API, SemVer
- ○ 1+ year, active maintenance, minor breaking changes
- △ Under 1 year or infrequent releases
- ✕ Experimental, no stable release

### Learning Curve

- ◎ Familiar paradigm, excellent docs, many tutorials
- ○ New concepts but well-documented
- △ Steep curve, sparse docs
- ✕ Poorly documented, requires source reading

### Community / Docs

- ◎ Large community, official docs, Stack Overflow presence
- ○ Active maintainers, adequate docs
- △ Small community, minimal docs
- ✕ Abandoned or single-maintainer

## Decision Record

After the user confirms, record the decision:

```markdown
### Decision: [Topic]

- **Chosen**: [Option]
- **Rationale**: [Why this over alternatives]
- **Alternatives considered**: [Options and why rejected]
- **Trade-offs accepted**: [Known downsides]
```

This should be saved to `docs/decisions/` per the workspace rules.
